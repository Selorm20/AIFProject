Overview

Welcome to the Alpha team project!
This task is aimed at implementing an agent in a smart pathfinding environment to reach its main goal of finding the quickest path while escaping the monster with limited number of steps. Hence, this collaborative and innovative effort by the team brings it into limelight.

Task

The agent starts the first level in a Minihack custom level skill environment surrounded by a broken wall and finds the shortest path using the Bread-first search & A * search method. With the help of simple commands, it is able to navigate to its destination while escaping the Wolf (monster) in about 18 steps.
