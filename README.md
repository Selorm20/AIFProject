Overview

Welcome to the Alpha team project!
This task is aimed at implementing an agent in a smart pathfinding environment to reach its main goal (target point) of finding a dynamic path while escaping the monster. Hence, this collaborative and innovative effort by the team brings it into limelight.

Task

The agent starts in an environment composed by lava cells and finds the dynamic path using the Bread-first search. With the help of simple commands, it is able to navigate to its destination while escaping the Coyote (monster).
